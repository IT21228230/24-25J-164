#  Disease Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of the **Automated Agriculture System** designed for **accurate water management** and **disease analysis** in tomato crops. The system leverages **machine learning**, **deep learning (CNNs)**, and **environmental data analysis** to provide real-time monitoring, disease detection, tailored interventions, and sustainable farming solutions.

## Project Overview

Growing tomatoes involves challenges such as managing diseases and optimizing resources. This project aims to:
- **Detect and diagnose tomato diseases** using image-based deep learning techniques.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for treatment and resource optimization.
- Promote **sustainable agricultural practices** by reducing chemical dependency and waste.

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous data collection from plants and environmental sensors.
2. **Disease Diagnosis**: Accurate identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections using CNN-based models.
3. **Tailored Interventions**: Customized fertilization and treatment plans based on real-time data.
4. **Scalability and Accessibility**: Designed for small to medium-sized farms.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Mobile app and web dashboard for monitoring and recommendations.

## System Architecture

The system follows the **MAPE Control Loop**:
1. **Monitor**: Collect plant images and environmental data.
2. **Analyze**: Detect disease symptoms and growth anomalies.
3. **Plan**: Generate treatment strategies tailored to specific conditions.
4. **Execute**: Automate irrigation and fertilization systems based on analysis.
